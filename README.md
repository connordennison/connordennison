## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Connor!

I normally spend my time programming in Python or some JavaScript derivation.
I enjoy making projects that are practical.

My current preffered language is JavaScript (frontend and backend node), combined with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management.

Currently learning Rust.

My preferred code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however I also use [Replit](https://replit.com/@cnnrde) (which runs on the Monaco editor too).

My contact information can be found on [my website](https://cnnd.co.uk) if you wish to get in touch with me. (My preferred method of contact is Twitter, I do not respond to 90% of my Discord friend requests)
