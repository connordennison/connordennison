## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Connor!

I normally spend my time making some obscure webapp with Next.js

My current preferred language is TypeScript, combined with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management.

My preferred code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however I also use [Replit](https://replit.com/@connor).

My contact information can be found on [my website](https://cnnd.co.uk) if you wish to get in touch with me. (My preferred method of contact is Twitter, but Discord works too)
