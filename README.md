### ðŸ‘‹

I'm Connor.

I normally spend my time programming in Python or Node.js, or making websites in HTML, CSS and JS.
I enjoy making projects that are practical, like my url shortener, [shorty](https://shrty.gq).

My favourite language is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), combined with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management.

My preferred code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however I also use [Replit](https://replit.com) (which runs on the Monaco editor too).

My contact information can be found on [my website](https://cnnd.co.uk), if you wish to get in touch with me.
