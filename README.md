## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Connor!

I normally spend my time programming in Python or Node.js, or making websites in HTML, CSS and JS or React.
I enjoy making projects that are practical.

You can view my public projects [here](https://cnnd.codes)!

My favourite language is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), combined with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management.

My preferred code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however I also use [Replit](https://replit.com) (which runs on the Monaco editor too).

My contact information can be found on [my website](https://cnnd.co.uk) if you wish to get in touch with me. (My preferred method of contact is Twitter, I do not respond to 90% of my Discord friend requests)
